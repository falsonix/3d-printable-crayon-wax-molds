# 3d-printable-crayon-wax-molds
An idea I had about using 3D-printed molds for pouring crayon wax, the basic concept is this:
- Crayons melt at ~50-60 degrees Celcius, and are easily available
- Most consumer 3D printer beds can reach temperatures much higher than the melting point of crayons
- Materials like ABS should be able to withstand the high heat (maybe)

Still heavily WIP, check back later!
